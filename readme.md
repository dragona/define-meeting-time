## Project Description:
This Android app aims to help users in different locations to coordinate meeting times. It displays the current time in various locations and allows users to convert and display the time in their local time zone. The app utilizes web services or APIs to retrieve the current time for each location and uses the timezone class to convert it to the user's local time zone.

## Use Case:
Suppose a team is working on a project, and the members are located in different parts of the world. The team needs to schedule a meeting, but it's challenging to coordinate a time that is suitable for everyone due to different time zones. In this case, the app can be useful, allowing each member to see the current time in their location and convert it to a time that is convenient for everyone.


## TODO list:

[x] Create a user interface (UI) that displays the time for each location. You can use a ListView, RecyclerView, or any other UI component that is appropriate.
[ ] Create a class that retrieves the current time for each location using a web service or API. There are several APIs available, such as the Google Maps Time Zone API, which provides time zone information for a given location.
[ ] Use the Timezone class to convert the retrieved time to the user's local time zone.
[ ] Display the converted time in the UI component.
[ ] Implement a mechanism to update the time periodically, so the user can see the latest time in each location.
[ ] Add any additional features you wish, such as the ability to add or remove locations, customize the UI, or share the time with others.
